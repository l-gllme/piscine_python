# Python Piscine

### Overview

This repository captures my journey through the Python Piscine, a curated series of projects designed to deepen my understanding of the Python programming language. These projects cover a spectrum of topics, ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced areas like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and data manipulation.

### Objectives

The Python Piscine serve as a comprehensive learning experience, breaking down complex concepts into manageable modules. The goal is not just to complete individual projects but to build a holistic understanding of Python development.


#### Projects

The following projects must be completed in sequential order:

1. [Python - 0 - Starting](#)
2. [Python - 1 - Array](#)
3. [Python - 2 - DataTable](#)
4. [Python - 3 - OOP](#)
5. [Python - 4 - Dod](#)
